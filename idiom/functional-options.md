It is a pretty common use case that you have some object which should work out-of-box using some basic default settings. 
In C, you can provide multiple versions of the same function with different numbers of arguments.
In C++, you can give parameters a default value and omit them when calling the method.
In Go, it does not support default parameter of function. However, there are a number of possible ways to do this.
